A) Steps Undertaken:

I commenced the project by unzipping the provided folder and initiating a new eReact project using the command npx create-react-app appName.
Upon examination of the interface and the essential imports, I delved into the sample file directory to grasp the necessary structuring.
To streamline the process, I opted out of routing and directly rendered the requisite component.
Through scrutinizing the exported and imported components, along with the dependencies affecting the desired output, insights were gleaned from the index.js files within folders.
To streamline the project, I eliminated superfluous contexts, filters, layouts, and components that were not utilized in the rendering process, focusing solely on the essential dependencies.
I replaced the Link tag provided by react-router-dom with anchor tag as told leveraging the window object for functionalities akin to useNavigate and useLocation.
The base path of vite.config.js was set to the root link for coherence.

B) Justification for Deviating from the Recommended Folder Structure:

I managed to streamline the nested folders into a primarily one-dimensional structure, although there are still some instances where nesting remains. I ensured that the majority of the folders were converted into components, but a few remained nested due to time constraints on my end.

C) Explanation for Incomplete Removal of Redundant Code within the Stipulated Deadline

I managed to clear out a significant portion of unused components and functions, which helped optimize the code for efficiency. However, I'm aware there might still be some instances of non-redundant code lurking around. I'm currently going through the code with a fine-tooth comb to spot any remaining areas that could use refinement. Additionally, I eliminated unnecessary authentication processes, I also removed any unused hooks. 

D) About functions and other redundant code
Hooks :-  Kept only one hook as other were redundant and not necessary
FakeApi: Removed Fake Api as there is no work of that dependency and also deleted wallet and other components related to it.
Authentication is not necessary so removed that as well.

Important : I removed unused functionalities like UseNavigate, Link, BrowserRouter, UseLocation, UseParams, and SearchParams. Additionally, I replaced Link components with anchor tags for simplicity.
